# Language Parser

This is an experiment with a sentence parser that could be used similar to
Cucumber to turn plain sentences into code. I would like to have this for my
One Page - Grimdark Future Army Builder. I came up with a nice set of code
conventions to test the upgrade functions, but when the unit upgrades get
adjusted it's a pain to adjust all the tests too since they require some manual
setup of the actual and expected conditions. Being able to just type in the
sentences and have the tests assemble themselves out of that would be great.

## TODO

   * Parse units into army definition data structure
   * Parse whole upgrade section
   *
