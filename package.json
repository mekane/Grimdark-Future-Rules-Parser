  "description": "This is an experiment with a sentence parser that could be used similar to Cucumber to turn plain sentences into code. I would like to have this for my One Page - Grimdark Future Army Builder. I came up with a nice set of code conventions to test the upgrade functions, but when the unit upgrades get adjusted it's a pain to adjust all the tests too since they require some manual setup of the actual and expected conditions. Being able to just type in the sentences and have the tests assemble themselves out of that would be great.",
